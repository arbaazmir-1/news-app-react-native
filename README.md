## Mini News
This is a React Native Expo app that uses Firebase and Redux. Currently, users can login, register, and view news. 
The main feature to be added is the ability to save news for later reading. However, there is an issue with Firebase authentication, 
where the user is not being kept signed in. I have posted a question on StackOverflow to try and find a solution. 
If you would like to help me out, please feel free to do so. Until the issue is resolved, the app will remain incomplete.
